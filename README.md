# Pacman-Game


📝 #Brief Application Description (Introduction) 

In this classic arcade-style game, you take control of a single human player represented by a smiley face 😃. Each turn, you'll be prompted to choose a direction in which to move Pacman. Your objective is to navigate Pacman through a maze, collecting treasures represented by gifts 🎁 until you've gathered all the pellets (yellow squares 🟨) scattered throughout the maze, or until Pacman collides with a ghost (enemies 👻) and loses a life. 


## Game Board Description

- Pacman (😃): Represented by a smiley face, this is the player-controlled character that moves around the maze.
- Pellets (🟨): Represented by yellow squares, these are the treasures Pacman collects. The game ends when all pellets are collected.
- Ghosts (👻): Represented by ghosts, these are the enemies Pacman must avoid. If Pacman collides with a ghost, the game ends.
- Walls (🧱): Represented by green crosses, these are barriers Pacman cannot pass through.
